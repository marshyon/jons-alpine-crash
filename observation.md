this change uses `x-bind` to alter the behavior of an HTML 'type' attribute 

```html
<input x-bind:type="showPass ? 'text' : 'password'" x-model="password">
```

and is bound to 'password' in the astro function and holds the literal password string entered by the user

`showpass` is a boolean value that is toggled by 

```html
<button type="button" @click="showPass = !showPass">
    <span x-text="showPass ? 'Hide' : 'Show'"></span>
</button>
```

a `@click` event in alpine and it toggles the `showpass` variable true / false

I can see how this can be very useful when handling form data and logins but I find the pattern a bit convoluted if not contrived, all using a number of 'things' to achieve a specific outcome

all these things and those like them can be used as cargo cult cut and paste when we know we want to do a given thing this is what we copy in to do the thing

we don't necessarily understand how the solution is derided, we just know this is how we can do something
